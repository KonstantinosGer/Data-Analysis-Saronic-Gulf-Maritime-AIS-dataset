# DataAnalysis-Saronic-Gulf-Maritime-AIS-dataset    
In the current work, we condacted statistical mining, visualization, data pre-processing and analysis on the Saronic Gulf Maritime AIS dataset which is comprised of vessel trajectories on the Saronic Gulf, Greece for a period of one week.  
Our work is organized mainly as followed:    

1. Data acquaintance  
2. Statistics extraction and visualization  
3. Trajectory segmenation  
4. Data analysis based on a custom similarity condition  
5. Temporal alignment of the trajectories  
6. Finding hot-spots on the data with the use of DBSCAN, OPTICS and kmeans algorithms  
7. Searching for group patterns among vessels using techniques like Flocks and Convoys    

The dataset as long as some assisting python files were provided from the Data Science Lab of the Department of Informatics - University of Piraeus.    

Last but not least, we want to pay gratitude to the Data Science Lab team for their guidance throughout this whole project.
